# arXiv-1901.08071

example.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook with a minimal example to produce the type of numerical results shown in the preprint arXiv:1901.08071.

The code requires qutip (https://github.com/qutip) to run. To be able to find optimal recoveries using SDP, the code moreover requires MATLAB to be installed and the python `matlab` module (https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html).

The code is not maintaned and no effort will be made to make it compatible with software versions other than those listed below.

The code has been tested with the following software:

| Software   | Version        |
|------------|----------------|
| QuTiP      | 4.3.0          |
| Numpy      | 1.14.3         |
| SciPy      | 1.1.0          |
| matplotlib | 2.2.2          |
| Python     | 3.6.5          |
| OS         | posix [darwin] |


| Software   | Version        |
|------------|----------------|
