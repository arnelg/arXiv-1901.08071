# arXiv-1901.08071

example.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook with a minimal example to produce the type of numerical results shown in the preprint arXiv:1901.08071.

The code requires qutip (https://github.com/qutip) to run. To be able to find optimal recoveries using SDP, the code moreover requires MATLAB to be installed, the python `matlab` engine (https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html), and CVX (http://cvxr.com/cvx/).

This code is made public to improve reproducibility of numerical results in arXiv:1901.08071. The code is not maintained and no effort will be made to make it compatible with software versions other than those listed below.

The code has been tested with the following software:
